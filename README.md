The purpose of this project was to build a timed multiple choice quiz which stored high scores.

How it works:

When the user clicks play they will be taken to question 1 where a timer will start and the user has to answer multiple choice questions in order to earn score to appear on the leaderboard.

A wrong answer will result in a time deduction. 

Once the user answers all questions they will enter their name in order to save the score to a leaderboard. On this page you may play again or return to the home screen.
